      <p>
        Students need a reliable and convenient way to park and move around campus because
        limited parking near residence halls makes it nearly impossible to leave without losing
        their spot.

        To resolve parking conflicts, the University could expand existing lots or build new
        ones, fix the existing app, or create a new app to provide accurate parking availability.
        Obstacles include funding, space, permissions, time, and human resources.
